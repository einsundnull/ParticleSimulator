# ParticleSimulator
This is a small program that simulates the behavior of particles.
It creates small circles that float around. 
They are all connected by lines.
By pressing C the particles colide instead of floating through each other.
By pressing L the connections between the particles become visible.
By scrolling the mouse wheel the simulation speed goes up/down.
By pressing Z the particles start floating in a 3D space.
By pressing +/- the particle size increases/decreases.
